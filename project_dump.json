        "description": "<p>Ferrari may rename its new cars and have a completely unique design for each. But the origins of the 488 go way back, all the way back to a V6-powered mid-engine car known as the Dino. The car that followed, the 308, got a larger V8 and that kicked off Maranello&rsquo;s most successful car line. However,<br />\r\nit was the next car, the 348, that set the template. While the Dino and the 308 had transversely located engines, the 348 was the first one to get a longitudinally mounted engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numeric names of the series have always indicated engine capacity. So, the 308 had a 3.0-litre V8, the 355 was a 3.5-litre engine (the last 5, though, stood for the number of valves per cylinder), and the 360 stood for the 3.6-litre engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, the 488 should have been the 39 something, but for its new 3.9-litre (now turbocharged for the first time) car, Ferrari switched to a naming system once used on its older V12s, where the number indicates the volume of one cylinder.</p>",
